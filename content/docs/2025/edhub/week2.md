- no support for course evaluation in general
- no attendance tracking mechanism
- no local hosting option (for data secutiry)

#### Moodle LMS

- a lot of unnecessary functionality that complicates the design
- no customization of criteria for evaluating assignments

#### Stepik

**Advantages (what we wnat to take):**

## Management: Plans & Prioritized backlog

We decided to split our project into several versions, each of which has full self-sufficient functionality. With each version new features are added to the project.

- **Materials**: Teacher can create courses, invite students, parents, or teachers, create materials. Student can enter the course and view the list of available materials. Parent can enter the course and view the list of available materials.
- **Assignment**: Teacher can create assignments, see the list of students' submissions and grade them. Student can submit assignments. Parents can track their students' submissions.
- **Files**: Teacher can attach files up to 5MB to course materials and assignments. Student can attach files up to 5MB to their submissions.

| Project Version | Backend | Frontend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Materials** | :ballot_box_with_check: Done in Week 1 | :white_check_mark: Done in Week 2 |
| **Assignment** | :white_check_mark: Done in Week 2 | :black_square_button: Planned for Week 3 |
| **Files** | :black_square_button: Planned for Week 3 | :black_square_button: Planned for Week 3 or Week 4 |

Since the project is dynamically changed, we plan to develop a detailed backlog at the beginning of each week. The backlog for Week 2 [was developed](https://github.com/orgs/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/projects/14/views/1) on June 12. The backlog for Week 3 will be extended after the meeting with TA.
